MonkeyMod
=========
This is a server plugin for Bukkit (bukkit.org)

It allows visitors to only view until given permission, if protection is enabled.

Originally designed to allow rapid world modifications through the use of 'boxy.'
As the game progressed and the community got larger 'griefers' became more and more of an issue. 
This mean't modifying this plugin to protect users creations.

This plugin disallows various items from being placed within the worlds
Perhaps a precious item has been stolen, admins can inspect users inventory.

	* spawn any items, even those with special data values.
	* set your compass heading
	* lock your chests preventing others from accessing them
	* log users chat, connections and disconnections
	* manage users access through a remote web portal (No longer operational) - src included
	* grant vip rights to users to spawn items or enable it for everyone
